# Shared PreToolUse hook — block catastrophic shell commands before they run.
#
# Reads the PreToolUse JSON payload on stdin, extracts tool_input.command,
# and matches it against a deny-list of unrecoverable / hard-to-undo
# patterns. Exits 2 (with the reason on stderr) to block the tool call;
# exits 0 to allow it.
#
# This is a mechanical backstop, NOT a substitute for the explicit-approval
# rule in AGENTS.md. The rule catches things like "git push" that are
# policy-gated but recoverable; the deny-list catches things that are
# truly unrecoverable: rm -rf on system paths, git clean -fd, history
# rewrites, disk writes, filesystem creates, terraform destroy,
# destructive SQL. (Force-push and hard reset are deliberately NOT
# listed — see the git section below.)
#
# It is also one layer, not the whole defense. The client's OS-level
# sandboxing and permission modes sit above this hook and are
# the right tool for unattended runs; client checkpoints and Git recover
# from mistakes the deny-list was never meant to catch. Keep this list narrow and
# false-positive-free rather than growing it toward a sandbox substitute.
#
# To bypass for a legitimate need:
#   - run the command outside the agent session (a regular terminal), or
#   - temporarily disable the PreToolUse hook in the active client config.
# Do not edit this script to silently allow a one-off — bypass deliberately.

# Extract tool_input.command from the JSON stdin payload using only sed —
# no python3 / jq dependency, so the hook works on a bare machine before
# `uv sync` has run. This is not a full JSON parser; it is a deliberate
# best-effort extraction:
#   1. flatten newlines (pretty-printed payloads) to spaces,
#   2. strip everything up to and including the `"command":"` key,
#   3. cut the value at its closing quote — the first `"` that is followed
#      by `}` or `,` (i.e. end of tool_input, or the next field).
# For the dangerous commands this list targets (no embedded quotes) the
# extraction is exact. Commands containing embedded quotes may be clipped,
# but the dangerous substring still survives for matching. If the
# `"command"` key isn't found at all, COMMAND is empty and we allow — the
# hook must never block the agent because of an extraction miss.
PAYLOAD="$(cat | tr '\n' ' ')"

# extraction miss falls through to "allow" rather than scanning the raw
# payload (which would false-positive on the description / cwd fields).
